We have a rectangular board divided into unit square cells. The board is mounted on a wall, with rows going horizontally and columns vertically. Each cell contains at most one box. You are given the current state of the board in the String[] board. The elements of board describe the rows of the board from top to bottom. (I.e., board[0] describes the topmost row of the board, and so on.) The characters of board[r] describe the cells in row r from left to right, with '.' being an empty cell and '#' a cell with a box.



Due to gravity, each box will fall down: whenever a cell below a box is empty, the box can fall into that cell. Thus, if you have a column with k boxes, those will eventually occupy the bottommost k cells in that column.



Please return a String[] describing the state of the board after all boxes finish falling down.

Definition

(be sure your method is public)


Constraints
-	board will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.

Examples
0)

{"#",
 ".",
 "."}
Returns: {".", ".", "#" }
This box will fall to the bottom, so we get:
.
.
#
1)

{"##",
 ".#",
 "#."}
Returns: {"..", "##", "##" }
This time we have 2 boxes in each column.
2)

{"..#.#",
 "#.#..",
 "...##"}
Returns: {".....", "..#.#", "#.###" }
3)

{"#####",
 "#####",
 "#####",
 "#####"}
Returns: {"#####", "#####", "#####", "#####" }
4)

{"."}
Returns: {"." }
